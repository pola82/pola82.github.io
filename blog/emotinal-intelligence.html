      <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
       <p>Emotional intelligence is born from the need for intelligent management of emotions.
       We have emotions that sometimes don't help us to live with others. Emotional intelligence
       allows us to recognize danger and fear. For example, fear is a defence mechanism because
       when we fear, we need more oxygen, so the heart beats faster, and the blood is more
       oxygenated and reaches the cells better. Therefore, we will be much more effective if we
       need an immediate response. Therefore, authentic management of emotions is a
       fundamental element everyone should have. Another essential factor is how to live with
       anger and bearing shame. All those elements can prevent regular action in our social life. In
       addition, social skills and fundamentally empathy are critical elements of emotional
       intelligence. Being able to put oneself in the other's place produces the power to
       understand what the other is doing, for example, why and how they are feeling.</p>
      <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
       <p>difference is that emotional intelligence measures how the human being handles
       emotions, for example, being empathetic and resolving conflicts. On the other hand, IQ
       measures the level of intelligence of human beings, such as how good you are at
       memorizing, reasoning, and mathematics.</p>
      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
       <p>intelligence is crucial because it helps us control our emotions; consequently,
       that will help us make better decisions.</p>
