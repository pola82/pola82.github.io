      <h2>What three new things have you learned about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
          that I am persevering
          that I can recognize my emotions now
          that I'm not stupid

      <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
          The roles of empathy and self-knowledge values are super important in any learning, but I feel that
          they are even more critical when we learn how to code. Learning to program is complex and requires
          a lot of empathy from the teachers to their students. On the other hand, self-awareness is essential
          because It allows us to know the emotions we are feeling during our learning. 

      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
          Neuroplasticity

      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
          Express my emotions in English

      <h2>Do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web 
          development Bootcamp course?</h2>
          Because as programmers, we don't work alone, we work as a team, and it is super important to have 
          the soft skills to be able not only to create web pages or make an application but also to be able to 
          get along with all the work team that we are going to have. Because we don't always get along well with
          our entire work team, but if there is understanding, empathy and respect, we will be the best team

      <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just 
          used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>    
          I have never taken it as a waste of time. On the contrary, It has helped me not to be so hard on myself.
