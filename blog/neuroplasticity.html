        <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>
          Neuroplasticity is a building mechanism within our nervous system that allows us to learn continually
          and grow throughout our lives. As a result, the thoughts and behaviours we engage in often get stronger, 
          while those we don't use often get weaker.              
          The benefits of Neuroplasticity can be seen in many areas, such as acquiring new capacities, human development,
          learning processes, improvement in cognitive abilities and more efficient communications between motor sensory networks.
      
          Neuroplasticity is present in the adult brain and can improve its functional capacity, stop pathological processes, promote
          the recovery of sensory losses and improve motor control, cognition and memory.
          Finally, brain plasticity plays a vital role in functional recovery after brain injury.
      
      
      
       <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of Neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h2>
          I will always practice the content from the BootCamp even though I have finished. In addition,
          I will do a lot of exercises, like running or going to the gym, because it has been proven that exercises help improve Neuroplasticity.

         <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

         <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h2>
             It is crucial to have a Growth Mindset because it helps to feel that as individuals,
             we have no limits and are capable of learning from everything and everything in life.
         <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
             No, because I knew bout Neoruplasticity
         <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
             I'll be kinder to myself, and I'll accept that it's okay to get frustrated

         <h2>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h2>
             Rereading these concepts is very good for me. Although I had read about Neuroplasticity and having a Growth Mindset,
             I had never put it into practice. As a result, I have always criticized myself. As I know, this week, I started to blame myself 
             because I don't learn fast, and when I have to write in English, I have to spend more time than a native speaker. 

            I know I have to change that way of thinking, especially at these times when the course starts to get more complicated. 
            But, I know that having positive thoughts and that I can learn everything I am studying now and apply it will allow me to reach the end.
