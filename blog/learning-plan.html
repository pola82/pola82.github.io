      <h1>My learning Plan</h1>
      <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
      <p>My strengths are perseverance and determination. On the other hand, my imitation is the English language<br>
          because I have to spend more time when I have to write. For example, the reflection part, I love that part of<br>
          the Dev Cademy. I think I started to retain more information in my brain since I began the reflection part,<br>
          but it took me time to do it.</p>



      <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
      <p> How to work on projects, and develop my confidence in general, so in the future, I can be able to lead projects.</p> 


      <h2> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
           An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners,<br>
          Facilitators and perseverance and industry/community representatives</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Not to go late to bed.</li>
          <li>the 8 hrs that a person needs</li>
          <li>well</li>
          <li>empathetic and understanding to others</li>
          <li>Go to the gym to manage my stress level and frustration.</li>
          <li> my homework on time.</li>
          <li>good communication with other learners and facilitators</li>
          <li>other students, facilitators, and community representatives</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>What will you do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h2>
          I will cry, take a break and mention it on the discord server because it probably will be a student in the same situation, but they have difficulty expressing themself. 
      <h2> A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
         <p>I will ask for help in the discord server between 8 am and 5 pm. 
          I will respect and understand that my facilitators have a life, and maybe they are busy with their families.

          I will ask for help on time, not wait for the last day and stress others. 

          I will wait for my time during the Bootcamp if the facilitators are busy helping other students.</p> 

       <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
          I expect from them comprehension and patience. 

        <h2>scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
          <p>For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>
          I'm not committed to other things, well, I have my husband, but he is a big boy and can be alone!</p>
