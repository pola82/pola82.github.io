                  When were blocked on a simple problem:
      
                </2>
                <h3>
                  1.What was the problem?
          
                </h3>
                  In general, all of sprint four has been difficult for me. To be more specific, 
                  the kata grade book and Build-in- methods were had for me. For example, in grade book the problem was created the method average. 
                  I didn't know how do get the average. I thought I had to do a complex mathematical operation in order
                  to get the average but it was not. On the other hand, in the building-methonds the problem was how to order the elements inside
                   a function. For example, which one goes first map() or split()?. After google and see some video on youtube, I got the answer.
          
                <h3>2.What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
                  Googling
                  Reading error messages 
                  Console.logging
                  Trying something
                  Asking peers and coaches for help
                  Watching youtube videos and order to review them save in my brain
          
                <h3>3.how did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
                    Bad and strees 
          
                <h3>4.what did you learn?</h3>
                    I learn that I can not spend one hour on a problem and if I don't get the answer ask for help. 
                    I need to spend more than an hour because it is when my brain saves the information.
          
                <h3>5. elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
                    I don't feel like I've solved a problem elegantly yet in programming. I need to organize myself more.
                    I think when I become confident, I will do it. It is just a bad feeling, but I know that feeling will disappear with time. The more practice, the better I will understand and organize myself.
          
                <h3>6. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
                <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
                    I'm not so confident. I need to practice more to have a habit of doing it before I start coding 
          
                <h3>Trying something</h3>
                    This sprint 4, I started to do it more. 
          
                <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
                    No confident yet
          
                <h3>
                  Reading error messages
                </3>
                  I feel reading error messages help me.
          
                <h3>Console.logging</h3>
                    Yes, console.log is one of my best friends now
          
                <h3>Googling</h3>
                  Google is where I first go when I don't understand something, so I feel confident with it 
          
                <h3>
                    Asking your peers for help
                </3>
                    I feel confident in asking for help
      
                <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
                    I feel confident in asking for help
          
                <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
                    I love this part and feel good reflecting on my learning process because without reflecting,
                    I wouldn't know if I'm learning.
