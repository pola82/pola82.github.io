               <h2>When were blocked on a simple problem:</2><br><br>
                <h3>1.What was the problem?</h3>
                  In general, all of sprint four has been difficult for me. To be more specific, 
                  the kata grade book and Build-in- methods were had for me. For example, in grade book the problem was created the method average. 
                  I didn't know how do get the average. I thought I had to do a complex mathematical operation in order
                  to get the average but it was not. On the other hand, in the building-methonds the problem was how to order the elements inside
                   a function. For example, which one goes first map() or split()?. After google and see some video on youtube, I got the answer.
          
                <h3>2.What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
                  Googling
                  Reading error messages 
                  Console.logging
                  Trying something
                  Asking peers and coaches for help
                  Watching youtube videos and order to review them save in my brain
          
                <h3>3.How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
                    Bad and strees 
          
                <h3>4.What did you learn?</h3>
                    I learn that I can not spend one hour on a problem and if I don't get the answer ask for help. 
                    I need to spend more than an hour because it is when my brain saves the information.
          
                <h3>5. Elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
                    I don't feel like I've solved a problem elegantly yet in programming. I need to organize myself more.
                    I think when I become confident, I will do it. It is just a bad feeling, but I know that feeling will disappear with time. The more practice, the better I will understand and organize myself.
          
                <h3>6. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
                <h3>. Pseudocode</h3> 
                  Is a great help when writing code. However, at the beginning of the foundation, 
                  I did't write Pseudode. Instead I copied and pasted the problem give it to me as a commment in visual studio code.
                  Over the days, I understood that it was a bad practice, so I stoped to do it. Now, I read the problem and bease
                  I write my Pseudocode.
                
                <h3>. Trying something</h3>
                    I think in this part I feel confident. During the kata challege when the code gave me an error and I didn't understand 
                    what was really happening. I did chenges for the code inmediately. For example. traying a forEach insteand of a forLoop. 
                    
          
                <h3>.Rubber ducky method</h3>
                    I think with this method, I still no master it because I haven't found the solution while I'm explaing a problem to someone else.
          
                <h3>. Reading error messages </h3>
                    I feel reading error messages help me alot, but I need more coding experience to understand all the message error.
          
                <h3>. Console.logging</h3>
                  I feel condident when I'm using Console.log because it lets me know what my program is doing
          
                <h3>. Googling</h3>
                  Google is where I first go when I don't understand something, so I feel confident with it 
          
                <h3>. Asking your peers for help</h3>
                    I feel confident in asking for help I if I'm stuck. I have done it all this time.
      
                <h3>. Asking coaches for help</h3>
                    I feel confident in asking for help if I stuck.Coaches are here to help and guide us on this learning journey.  
          
                <h3>. Improving your process with reflection</h3>
                    I love this part and feel good reflecting on my learning process because without reflecting,
                    I wouldn't know if I'm learning.
