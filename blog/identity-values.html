       <h2 id="bandi">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.<br>
        Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision,
        the decision you made,<br> and how you reflect on the decision now.</h2>


       <p>When I was working in an elderly care home, I was told that I only need to call the ambulance when a patient is in a terrible condition,<br>
          and I said ok, good, but one day, one of the residents at the elderly care home started to feel bad, so I called the nurse,<br>
          and the nurse told me that the person was excellent. I didn't believe it. Something inside me started to worry about him.<br>
          After such a long time taking care of him and knowing that his advanced dementia didn't allow him to communicate,<br>
          I knew something was wrong, so I called the nurse again, and the nurse replied that the patient was excellent and that as a nurse,<br>
          she knew more than me. I felt pretty bad that day because I didn't have the power to help him. Suddenly, the nurse left, and I called<br>
          the ambulance. At that moment, I didn't think that I might get in trouble. At that moment, I only felt that I needed to help him<br>
          because it was my job, and it was unethical to let him die. What can I say about that situation now? It can say that I don't regret at all<br>
          for the decision that I made that day. Why? Because I studied to take care of people.</p>
 
 
 
      <h2 id="qaali">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>

       <p> I come from Chile, a country where you can see poverty. A country where not all its residents have a house and education access. <br>
           In addition, my mother is a Christian, so from a very young age, I saw the reality of what others had in my country. As a member of the church,<br>
           my mother always took me to help people who didn't have money. That helped me to be grateful for what I had.<br><br>
 
          Furthermore, as a native American Indian, my father taught me to love the earth and be grateful to mother nature. All those values,<br>
           plus the experience of living in a different country, have made me the person I am today, an empathetic person who cares about the people <br>
           around her and an animal lover who thinks that happiness relies on our life experiences, not material things.</p>
 
 
 
      <h2 id="luke">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h2>

        <p>My strength is perseverance and determination when I do something, even though things get complicated. <br>
      I think these values will be of great help because programming is not easy, and I see how the course is getting<br>
       more complex as it advances.</p>
 
      <h2 id="tom">your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>

        <p>I think my limitations are that I can get stressed, but I don't show it. Also, the English language sometimes feels like a limitation.<br>
           Because it is not my first language, it is more difficult for me to express what I think, especially in the reflection part.<br>
           Finally, I have to admit that I sometimes feel low self-esteem regarding programming due to how I've been learning.<br>
           I think all those things together can affect my learning journey.</p>
 
 
 
      <h2 id="sara">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance <br>or tension.
          Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on <br>what other strategies
          you would try now and why.</h2>
 
 
        <p> happened at my old job. We worked four people for each department, but not everyone worked the same way,<br> 
          so sometimes it felt like only two of us were doing the job of all four, creating many conflicts, so I changed the strategy. <br>
         I took the time my patients needed and did not rush to other patients when my co-workers were not doing anything.<br>
         This strategy worked well. People started to do their job and not leave all to others. <br>
         I think one of the strategies I will do now is to talk to them about why they don't take care of their duty at work.<br>
         Why are they not productive and not cooperating? Sometimes people have a personal problem in their life, and they do not tell anyone.<br>
         Instead, people keep it inside, and that starts affecting their everyday lives.</p>
